# Let's Talk Whale
Here we take a phrase like "turpentine and turtles" or anything else and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent, "uueeieeauuee" or something else.

There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

* There are no consonants. Only vowels.
* The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them.

Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is custom in the ocean.
