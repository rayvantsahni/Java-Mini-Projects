# Harry Potter and the Sorting Hat Quiz
**_“A thousand years or more ago,_**

**_When I was newly sewn,_**

**_There lived four wizards of renown,_**

**_Whose names are still well known.”_**



The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry welcomes you! First-year students must go through the annual Sorting Ceremony.

The Sorting Hat is a talking hat at Hogwarts that magically determines which of the four school Houses each new student belongs most to:

* `gryffindor`
* `hufflepuff`
* `ravenclaw`
* `slytherin`
