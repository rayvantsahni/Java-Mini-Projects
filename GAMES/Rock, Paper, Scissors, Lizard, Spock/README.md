You may have played Rock, Paper, Scissors, but have you played Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock? This is the infamous game brought to popularity with the TV show The Big Bang Theory.


Note from the creator, Sam Kass:

**“I invented this game (with Karen Bryla) because it seems like when you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock Paper Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. Well, here is a slight variation that reduces that probability. This version is also nice because it satisfies the Law of Fives.”**
