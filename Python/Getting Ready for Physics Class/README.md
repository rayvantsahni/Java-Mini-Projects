# Getting Ready for Physics Class
We just pretend to be a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester. We want to provide our students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.
The program includes functions for - 
* Temperature
* Force
* Work "\n"
Many more such properties could be defined here..
