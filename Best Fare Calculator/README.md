# Best Fare Calculator

### Project Goal
If you’ve ever wondered whether you chose the right fare option for riding the metro or bus, you’re not alone. In this project we will write a Java program that determines the best fare option for someone visiting New York City who plans to use the NYC transit system.

The NYC transit system has three regular fare options:
* Pay-per-ride (single ride): $2.75
* 7-day Unlimited Rides: $33.00
* 30-day Unlimited Rides: $127.00

The NYC transit system also offers reduced fare options for people with disabilities and people who are at least 65 years old. So the programs checks if the rider qualifies for reduced fare and calculates the best reduced fare option if they do.

* Pay-per-ride (single ride): $1.35
* 7-day Unlimited Rides: $16.50
* 30-day Unlimited Rides: $63.50
