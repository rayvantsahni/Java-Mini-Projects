# DNA Sequencing
The genome of an organism stores all the genetic information necessary to build and maintain that organism. It is an organism’s complete set of DNA.
DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as:

`A`: Adenine
`C`: Cytosine
`G`: Guanine
`T`: Thymine

So a strand of DNA could look something like `ACGAATTCCG`.

A protein has the following qualities:
1. It begins with a “start codon”: ATG.
2. It ends with a “stop codon”: TGA.
3. In between, each additional codon is a sequence of three nucleotides.

This program checks whether there is a protein in a strand of DNA or not.
