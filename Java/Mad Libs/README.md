# Mad Libs
Here, we write a Mad Libs word game! Mad Libs have short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:
* A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
* Words from the player to fill in those blanks.
