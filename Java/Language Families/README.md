# Language Families
Languages, just like people, often have families. You can even map language lineage a bit like a family tree.
In this project, we take into consideration something, that often varies between language families: word order â€” where the subject, verb, and object would go in a sentence.

For example, in English, you would use subject-verb-object order:
**subject verb object** (*She	eats	noodles*)

This project has 3 classes -
`Language.java`: for the Language parent class, which serves as the template for all languages.
`Mayan.java`: for Mayan, a child class of Language modeled after the Mayan language family.
`SinoTibetan.java`: for SinoTibetan, a child class of Language modeled after the Sino-Tibetan language family.
