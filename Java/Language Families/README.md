# Language Families
Languages, just like people, often have families. You can even map language lineage a bit like a family tree.
In this project, we take into consideration something, that often varies between language families: word order â€” where the subject, verb, and object would go in a sentence.

For example, in English, you would use subject-verb-object order:
**subject verb object**
_She	  eats	 noodles_
