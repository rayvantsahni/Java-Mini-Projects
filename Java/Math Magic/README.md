# Math Magic
In this project, we will become a mathemagician and write a small program that performs a mathematical magic trick! It will involve performing arithmetic operations on an integer that you choose.

So the best part about this program is that no matter what our intial number is, we always end up at the same number after performing certain arithmetic operation on the intial number.
